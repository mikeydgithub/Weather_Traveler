## Weather_Traveler

# Purpose

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Built With

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

# How it works

* A weather dashboard is formed with inputs for you to enter what city, state, or country in which you want to find the weather for.
* When you search for a location you can find the current and future conditions for that location up to 5 days.
* You will get back information about the 

    * Current temperature.
    * Details on weather condition and icon representation.
    * Wind speed with it's direction.
    
* You can track multiple locations. After your your search is entered it is saved and can be reselected to go back to.

# Result

* A website that tells you the current weather and it's future weather conditions using openweathermap API to fetch data from.
